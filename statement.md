# Hello World!

This Python template lets you get started quickly with a simple one-page playground.

```python runnable
print('Hello World!')   #anything we want to print can be inside single quotes...(this is a single line comment)
print("First python program!")   #.. or double quotes
```

# Advanced usage

If you want a more complex example (external libraries, viewers...), use the [Advanced Python template](https://tech.io/select-repo/429)
